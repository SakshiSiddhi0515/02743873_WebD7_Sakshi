-- Variables in CSS
Prefixed with $
$primary-color: blue

-- Nesting

Instead of writing parent class name again and again, we can include all child classes of particular parent class
under respective parent class writing once

-- Modules
We can break css in separate files and bring them into one main css file
_filename.scss : writing _ will not compile the file. 
you can use those modules using @use keyword in another sass file
@use 'filename'


-- Mixins
It is just like the function which takes a parameter where value could be css property
You can place css inside mixin and use parameter value to assign it to different css properties
To use mixins we need to use keyword @include

-- functions
Functions work same as mixins, but the only difference is that they return something


-- Inheritance
There are cases where we have similar styles to some components except few extra styles. For that we need to write similar 
lines of css again and again
To avoid that we can use inheritance 
You can create one block of similar properties and extend that in the different classes where you want the similar styles

-- Operators
It can be used to make calculations
You can write formula for your css property

-- Conditionals
Like if else loop 
makes it more like a programming language
